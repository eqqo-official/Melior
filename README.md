# Melior
A vanilla+ mod focused on beautification and immersion.

Original mod ideas and choice implementation of existing mods' features, unified into a single place to best imitate the experience of Eqqo's Minecraft world.

### Planned Feature List:

## Cobbled stone variants

<p align="center">
  <img src=https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/Cobbled%20Stones.png
</p>

Cobbled **GRANITE, ANDESITE & DIORITE** to replace the dropped item when mining ***without*** Silk Touch.
Also obtainable through the **STONECUTTER**.

Potentially add Cobbled variants for **TUFF, CALCITE** & **DRIPSTONE** too.

## Minimal HUD

<p align="center">
  <img src=https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/hotbar.gif
</p>

Remove **CROSSHAIR** and **POTION EFFECTS** from HUD, and implement **AUTOHIDE HOTBAR**.

When the player scrolls the hotbar reappears for a few seconds then hides away again for that *minimal aesthetic*.

>Example mods provided in ***Mods for Resource*** folder - *give credit where due - (**MinimalHUD** was a mod I had commissioned, so no credit needed there)*

## Dried Nether Wood

<p align="center">
  <img src=https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/Dried%20Nether%20Wood.png
</p>

Dried variants of **WARPED STEM** and **CRIMSON STEM** and all of their accompanying hyphae/stripped/planks/stairs/slabs/fences etc.

Obtained by smelting those blocks into their respective ***DRIED*** variants

## Heart of the Sea Magnet

</p>

The enigmatic **HEART OF THE SEA** acts like a magnet attracting items upto **7** blocks away (potentially configurable).
  
Right click it whilst holding to ACTIVATE or DEACTIVATE the magnet functionality.

## Villager Fixes

Implementation of another mod I had commissioned that stops the **VILLAGERS** from forgetting where their **BED** and **WORKSTATION** was.

Potentially also add a fix for the villager AI's confusion around **TRAPDOORS**.

<p align="center">
  <img src=https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/villager-trapdoor.gif
</p>

Also implement ***ZOMBIE-PROOF DOORS*** so villagers are safe once they're inside.

## Remove Black Sky

<p align="center">
  <img src=https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/void.gif
</p>

Removal of the lower half of the screen turning black below **Y=60**.

## Wind

The addition of **WIND** through the manipulation of the *Shaders/World/Animation Speed*, gradually ramping up and down.
  
Combined with matching **WIND SOUNDS**
  
And potentially the directional *blowing* of particles - campfire smoke / rain / potion effects, etc.

  # Implementation of other mods' features:

Depending on the licensing, these chosen mod features may be able to be extracted and implemented with proper credit given, in order to trim unwanted content.

Or instead, inclusion of config-set mods in a potential **MELIOR MODPACK**
  
  Include credit and reference to all mods included.
  
# Better Foliage

## Vertical Slabs

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/vertical-slabs.jpg">
  They exist for every vanilla block that has a slab, and can be crafted by placing 3 of the respective slab in a column.
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## More Potted Plants
  
<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/more-potted-plants.jpg">
  17 new blocks can now be added to Flower Pots. The feature image shows a bunch, but you can also add the vanilla 2 tall flowers, and nether wart.

  Twisted vines, warped vines, large ferns, tall grass, vines, and nether sprouts are also added.
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## Shear vines
  
<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/shear-vine-tips.jpg">
  The tip of a vine can now be right clicked with Shears.
  
When you do so, the vine will no longer be able to grow.
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## Thatch

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/thatch.jpg">
  Thatch is created via a 2x2 of Wheat. It can be used for stairs and slabs or turned back into 4 Wheat. You can use it for some fancy medieval roof styles.
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## Variant Bookshelves

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/variant-bookshelves.jpg">
  You can now make Bookshelves out of all wood types. All of these bookshelves work for the Enchanting Table too.
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## Variant Chests

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/variant-chests.jpg">
  Chests can be made of all the different wood types. Each one is styled differently for the type of wood you use.

  To get the vanilla chest, you can craft a chest with more than one type of wood, or woods added by other mods.

  These variant chests will also replace the chests found in structures in the world.

  Variant Chests can be converted into Vanilla Chests by placing them in a crafting table.

## Variant Ladders

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/variant-ladders-1.18.jpg">
  Ladders can be made of all the different wood types.
  
  To compensate for the fact that sticks do not come in different wood types, the recipe for ladders is changed to have a single plank of the corresponding wood type in the center.
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## Variant Furnaces

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/variant-furnaces.jpg">
  Furnaces crafted from Deepslate or Blackstone have new textures. Additionally, Blackstone Furnaces can emit soul fire particles if placed over a block that can light up with soul fire.

Otherwise, they both behave the same as normal Furnaces.
  
  <br clear="left"/>
  
## Wooden Posts

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/wooden-posts.jpg">
  Wooden Posts can be crafted with Logs or Stripped Logs. These are slim log style blocks you can lay down vertically or horizontally. Chains and lanterns can also connect to them.
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## Greener Grass

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/greener-grass.jpg">
  Grass is greener on the Quark side. Biome colors are still respected, but are greener non the less.
  
  >No need to include Quark's config option.
  
  <br clear="left"/>
  
## Improved Tooltips

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/improved-tooltips.jpg">
 A few tooltips are changed around the place with visual elements:

- Tools and armor have their attributes displayed with icons.
- Food shows how much it'll heal with icons, and will show when it'll give you negative effects.
- Shulker Boxes show their contents visually.
- Maps display in the tooltip.
- Enchanted Books show which items they can be applied to.
  
  <br clear="left"/>
  
## Variant Animal Textures

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/variant-animal-textures.jpg">
  Cows, Pigs, and Chicken will now have randomized textures from a small pool of variants.
  >Remove the *special rare variants*
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## Automatic Recipe Unlock

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/automatic-recipe-unlock.jpg">
  Every single recipe is unlocked and displayed in the recipe book as soon as you load a world.

If new recipes are added to the game via new mods added or updated, those will be unlocked when you get back in.

This feature is an exception to the general quark theme, but since you are using mods, it's fair to assume you don't need the game to spoon-feed you recipes.
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## Double Door Opening

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/double-door-opening.jpg">
  Double doors open together when right clicked. Finally!
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## Hoe Harvesting

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/hoe-harvesting.jpg">
  Breaking grass or crops with a hoe will break a 3x3 of them. A Diamond Hoe will break a 5x5 instead. If you put Fortune on the hoe, it'll also apply that effect to everything it breaks.
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## Simple Harvest

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/simple-harvest.jpg">
  Right clicking a crop will harvest it and replant it. If you have Hoe Harvesting enabled, you can also harvest a large area at once.
  
  <br clear="left"/>
  
## Villagers Follow Emeralds

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/villagers-follow-emeralds.jpg">
  Holding an Emerald Block causes nearby villagers to follow the player, much like animals do for food items.
