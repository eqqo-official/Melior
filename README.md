# Melior
Beautification mod that gently tweaks the vanilla experience

Feature List plan:

## Cobbled stone variants

![cobbled_stones](https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/20a3fea3f24c84a6f8d0acb7df20168ba7677fd8/Graphics/Cobbled%20Stones.png)

Cobbled **GRANITE, ANDESITE & DIORITE** to replace the dropped item when mining ***without*** Silk Touch.
Also obtainable through the **STONECUTTER**.

Potentially add Cobbled variants for **TUFF, CALCITE** & **DRIPSTONE** too.

## Minimal HUD

Remove **CROSSHAIR** and **POTION EFFECTS** from HUD, and implement **AUTOHIDE HOTBAR**

When the player scrolls the hotbar reappears for a few seconds then hides away again for that *minimal aesthetic*
