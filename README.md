# Melior
Beautification mod that gently tweaks the vanilla experience

Feature List plan:

## Cobbled stone variants

Cobbled **GRANITE, ANDESITE & DIORITE** to replace the dropped item when mining ***without*** Silk Touch.
Also obtainable through the **STONECUTTER**.

Potentially add Cobbled variants for **TUFF, CALCITE** & **DRIPSTONE** too.

## Minimal HUD

Remove **CROSSHAIR** and **POTION EFFECTS** from HUD, and implement **AUTOHIDE HOTBAR**.

When the player scrolls the hotbar reappears for a few seconds then hides away again for that *minimal aesthetic*.

>Example mods provided in ***Mods for Resource*** folder - *give credit where due - (**MinimalHUD** was a mod I had commissioned, so no credit needed there)*

## Dried Nether Wood

Dried variants of **WARPED STEM** and **CRIMSON STEM** and all of their accompanying hyphae/stripped/planks/stairs/slabs/fences etc.

Obtained by smelting those blocks into their respective ***Dried*** variants

## Heart of the Sea Magnet

The enigmatic HEART OF THE SEA acts like a magnet. Right click it whilst holding to ACTIVATE or DEACTIVATE the magnet functionality.

## Villager Fixes

Implementation of another mod I had commissioned that stops the **VILLAGERS** from forgetting where their **BED** and **WORKSTATION** was.

Potentially also add a fix for the villager AI's confusion around **TRAPDOORS**.

Also implement ***ZOMBIE-PROOF DOORS*** so villagers are safe once they're inside.
