# Melior
A vanilla+ mod focused on beautification and immersion.

Original mod ideas and choice implementation of existing mods' features, unified into a single place to best imitate the experience of Eqqo's Minecraft world.

### Planned Feature List:

## Cobbled stone variants

</p>

Cobbled **GRANITE, ANDESITE & DIORITE** to replace the dropped item when mining ***without*** Silk Touch.
Also obtainable through the **STONECUTTER**.

Potentially add Cobbled variants for **TUFF, CALCITE** & **DRIPSTONE** too.

## Minimal HUD

</p>

Remove **CROSSHAIR** and **POTION EFFECTS** from HUD, and implement **AUTOHIDE HOTBAR**.

When the player scrolls the hotbar reappears for a few seconds then hides away again for that *minimal aesthetic*.

>Example mods provided in ***Mods for Resource*** folder - *give credit where due - (**MinimalHUD** was a mod I had commissioned, so no credit needed there)*

## Dried Nether Wood

</p>

Dried variants of **WARPED STEM** and **CRIMSON STEM** and all of their accompanying hyphae/stripped/planks/stairs/slabs/fences etc.

Obtained by smelting those blocks into their respective ***DRIED*** variants

## Heart of the Sea Magnet

</p>

The enigmatic **HEART OF THE SEA** acts like a magnet attracting items upto **7** blocks away (potentially configurable).
  
Right click it whilst holding to ACTIVATE or DEACTIVATE the magnet functionality.

## Villager Fixes

Implementation of another mod I had commissioned that stops the **VILLAGERS** from forgetting where their **BED** and **WORKSTATION** was.

Potentially also add a fix for the villager AI's confusion around **TRAPDOORS**.

Also implement ***ZOMBIE-PROOF DOORS*** so villagers are safe once they're inside.

# Implementation of other mods' features:

Some of these mods may not be updated to 1.19 so inclusion in this unified mod makes sense.
Depending on the licensing, these chosen mod features may be able to be extracted and implemented with proper credit given, in order to trim unwanted content.
  
  Include credit and reference to all mods included.

(If integrated implementation not allowed, some way of disabling all but the chosen features of other necessary mods wouldhave to be the workaround)

## Vertical Slabs

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/vertical-slabs.jpg">
  They exist for every vanilla block that has a slab, and can be crafted by placing 3 of the respective slab in a column.

## More Potted Plants
  
<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/more-potted-plants.jpg">
  17 new blocks can now be added to Flower Pots. The feature image shows a bunch, but you can also add the vanilla 2 tall flowers, and nether wart.

  Twisted vines, warped vines, large ferns, tall grass, vines, and nether sprouts are also added.

## Shear vines
  
<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/shear-vine-tips.jpg">
  The tip of a vine can now be right clicked with Shears.
  
When you do so, the vine will no longer be able to grow.

## Thatch

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/thatch.jpg">
  Thatch is created via a 2x2 of Wheat. It can be used for stairs and slabs or turned back into 4 Wheat. You can use it for some fancy medieval roof styles.
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## Variant Bookshelves

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/variant-bookshelves.jpg">
  You can now make Bookshelves out of all wood types. All of these bookshelves work for the Enchanting Table too.
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## Variant Chests

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/variant-chests.jpg">
  Chests can be made of all the different wood types. Each one is styled differently for the type of wood you use.

  To get the vanilla chest, you can craft a chest with more than one type of wood, or woods added by other mods.

  These variant chests will also replace the chests found in structures in the world.

  Variant Chests can be converted into Vanilla Chests by placing them in a crafting table.

## Variant Ladders

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/variant-ladders-1.18.jpg">
  Ladders can be made of all the different wood types.
  
  To compensate for the fact that sticks do not come in different wood types, the recipe for ladders is changed to have a single plank of the corresponding wood type in the center.
  
  <br clear="left"/>

## Variant Furnaces

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/variant-furnaces.jpg">
  Furnaces crafted from Deepslate or Blackstone have new textures. Additionally, Blackstone Furnaces can emit soul fire particles if placed over a block that can light up with soul fire.

Otherwise, they both behave the same as normal Furnaces.

## Wooden Posts

<img align="left" width="200px" src="https://github.com/eqqo-official/Melior/blob/main/Graphics/wooden-posts.jpg">
  Wooden Posts can be crafted with Logs or Stripped Logs. These are slim log style blocks you can lay down vertically or horizontally. Chains and lanterns can also connect to them.
